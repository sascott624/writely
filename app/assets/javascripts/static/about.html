  <h4>Welcome to Writely! A site for inspiration and creative writing.

  <br><br>

  The idea behind Writely is simple: on the <a href="" ui-sref="create">create</a> page, you are given a directive to write a short sample using a randomly generated word. These samples range from a standard dialogue or poem, to the more obscure (such as a doctor's note or tardy excuse).

  <br><br>

  If the selected word does not suit, you may simply click the word to generate a new, random selection (the same may be done for the genre of writing).

  <br><br>

  Once you are satisfied with your writing sample, you may publish it to our <a href="" ui-sref="archive">archive</a> for other writers to view! You may browse through the archive, or you also have the option of allowing our <a href="" ui-sref="random">random</a> tab to randomly select a writing sample for you to enjoy.

  <br><br>

  Thanks for stopping by!
